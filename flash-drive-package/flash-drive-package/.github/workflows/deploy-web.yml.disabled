# This workflow is disabled because manual deployment is being used
# To enable automatic deployment, you need to:
# 1. Get Vercel token from: https://vercel.com/account/tokens
# 2. Get Org ID and Project ID from Vercel dashboard
# 3. Add these as secrets in GitHub repository settings
# 4. Uncomment this workflow
